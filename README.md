- Rate movies and episodes after watching them
- Custom skin/keymap actions for toggling watched status, and rating (tagging and listing disabled for now)

### What can be scrobbled?

This plugin will scrobble local media and most remote streaming content. Local media should be played in Kodi library mode. Trakt will attempt to identify the media through different third party IDs available from the metadata. TV shows are identified by TVDb ID or IMDb ID. Movies are identified by TMDb ID or IMDb ID. This allows Trakt to match the correct show or movie more accurately, regardless of the title. The best supported and recommended configuration is to use [TVDb](http://thetvdb.com/) (for tv shows) and [TMDb](http://themoviedb.org) (for movies) as your scrapers.

Remote streaming content will scrobble assuming the metadata is correctly set in Kodi. Add-ons that stream content need to correctly identify TV episodes and movies with as much metadata as possible for Trakt to know what you're watching.

### Installation

If you're not a developer, you should only install this from the official Kodi repo via Kodi itself. If you are a dev, here is how you install the dev version:

1. Download the zip ([download it here](../../zipball/main))
2. Install script.trakt by zip. Go to _Settings_ > _Add-ons_ > _Install from zip file_ > Choose the just downloaded zip
3. Navigate to _Settings_ > _Add-ons_ > _Enabled add-ons_ > _Services_ > **Trakt**
4. Select _Trakt_ and go to **Configure**
5. Get your **PIN** [here](http://www.trakt.tv/pin/999) and enter it, change any other settings as needed
6. Select **OK** to save your settings
7. Watch _something_ and see it show up on Trakt.tv!

or

1. Clone this repository (or [download it here](../../zipball/main)) into a folder called **script.trakt** inside your Kodi **addons** folder
2. Start Kodi (or restart if its already running)
3. Make sure you have the modules Trakt and dateutil installed. Check under _Settings_ > _Add-ons_ > _Get Add-ons_ > _All Add-ons_ > _Add-on libraries_ (restart if you had to install these)
4. Navigate to _Settings_ > _Add-ons_ > _Enabled add-ons_ > _Services_ > **Trakt**
5. Select _Trakt_ and go to **Configure**
6. Get your **PIN** [here](http://www.trakt.tv/pin/999) and enter it, change any other settings as needed
7. Select **OK** to save your settings
8. Watch _something_ and see it show up on Trakt.tv!

Please note that _something_ does not cover all Kodi possible streaming sources. Local files and strm files scrapped to your library should be OK, however generic third party streaming addons can fail. It is up to the developers of these addons to be supported by this plugin. Please take a look https://github.com/trakt/script.trakt/wiki/Providing-id's-to-facilitate-scrobbling

### Problems?

#### "I found something that doesn't work"

- Search the issues on github to see if it has already been reported, if so add your information there.
- If not, create a new issue and provide as much data about your system as possible, a logfile will also be needed.

#### Creating logfiles

- To create a logfile, enable the debug setting in Kodi AND script.trakt, otherwise the logfile won't show any data from script.trakt. Check the [Kodi documentation](http://kodi.wiki/view/Log_file) if you don't know where your logfile can be found.

#### Invoke sync via jsonrpc

Save this as `kodi-trakt-update.sh`

```bash
#!/bin/sh

# url to kodi jsonrpc
url=http://localhost:8080/jsonrpc

# https://github.com/trakt/script.trakt/issues/192#issuecomment-70359374
request='{
        "jsonrpc":"2.0",
        "method":"Addons.ExecuteAddon",
        "params":{
                "addonid":"script.trakt",
                "params":{
                        "action":"sync",
                        "silent":"False"
                }
        },
        "id":1
}'

exec curl -sSLf --include --header 'content-type: application/json;' --request POST --data-binary "$request" "$url"
```
